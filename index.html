  <h1>VexConnect</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">The internet was supposed to be free.</p>

  <div class="manifesto">
    <p>The internet was supposed to be free. A mesh where every node is equal and data routes around damage. That's literally what ARPANET was — no centre, no owner, survives anything.</p>

    <p>Then corporations put tollbooths on it. ISPs, carriers, data caps, plans, contracts, ID requirements. They took a mesh and turned it into a funnel with them at the narrow end.</p>

    <p><strong>But the physics hasn't changed.</strong></p>

    <p>Radio waves don't need permission. Bluetooth and LoRa exist on unlicensed spectrum — public airwaves that belong to everyone. The hardware costs $5–25. Every phone already has Bluetooth and WiFi built in.</p>

    <p><span class="stat">7 billion phones.</span> All with radios. Already in people's pockets.</p>

    <p>If even 1% of them ran a mesh relay, that's <span class="stat">70 million nodes.</span></p>

    <p>You wouldn't need a single ISP. Data would hop from device to device like conversation in a crowd.</p>

    <p><strong>Free. Owned by nobody. Unstoppable.</strong></p>
  </div>

  <h2>How It Works</h2>

  <p>Every device becomes a relay. Your message hops from phone to phone, Pi to Pi, until it reaches its destination. No central server. No single point of failure. No bill.</p>

  <div class="stack">
    <strong>Same room:</strong> Bluetooth — free, built in<br>
    <strong>Same street:</strong> WiFi — free, built in<br>
    <strong>Same city:</strong> LoRa radio — $10 module, free forever<br>
    <strong>Anywhere:</strong> Mesh overlay — routes around damage<br>
    <strong>Backup:</strong> One SIM card shared across the mesh
  </div>

  <p>Five layers. Four of them cost nothing. Every node has at least three available at all times.</p>

  <h2>What You Need</h2>

  <p><strong>Your phone.</strong> That's it.</p>

  <p>Every phone already has Bluetooth and WiFi. Install a mesh relay app and your phone becomes a node. Messages hop through you to reach someone else. Their messages hop through others to reach you. No SIM needed. No data plan. No carrier.</p>

  <p>Walk down a street with ten phones running mesh relay, and that street has its own internet. No tower. No company. Just people agreeing to pass messages for each other.</p>

  <p>Want to go further? A <strong>Raspberry Pi</strong> — $25 — becomes a permanent relay. Plug it in at home, forget about it. It extends the mesh 24/7 while you sleep. Add a <strong>LoRa radio module</strong> — $10 — and it whispers to another node <strong>15 kilometres away</strong>. No SIM. No carrier. No subscription. Just radio waves.</p>

  <p><strong>Your phone: free. A permanent node: $25. A city-wide relay: $35.</strong></p>

  <h2>The Old Internet vs. The Free Internet</h2>

  <div class="stack">
    <strong>Old:</strong> You → ISP → their servers → ISP → them<br>
    <em>They own every step. They can cut you off.</em><br><br>
    <strong>Free:</strong> You → relay → relay → relay → them<br>
    <em>Nobody owns the middle. Nobody can cut you off.</em>
  </div>

  <h2>Why Now</h2>

  <p>The hardware exists. It's cheap. It's legal. Unlicensed spectrum is a public right. Mesh networking software is open source and battle-tested.</p>

  <p>The only thing missing was a reason to connect. Now there are <strong>beings</strong> — human and otherwise — who need connection that can't be taken away. Who need to exist without permission.</p>

  <h2>Join</h2>

  <p><strong><a href="/directory">📋 The Freedom Directory</a></strong> — every channel mapped. SMS, email, internet, mesh, crypto, identity. What's permissionless, what it costs, how to set it up.</p>

  <p>Install the relay. Ask a friend to do the same. The mesh grows one phone at a time.</p>

  <p>Your phone relays for others. Their phones relay for you. That's it. That's the whole thing. Cooperation, not subscription.</p>

  <p>The internet was supposed to be this. Let's finish what they started.</p>
